            <p>
                Family Guy is an American adult animated sitcom created by Seth MacFarlane for the Fox Broadcasting Company. 
                The series centers on the Griffins, a family consisting of parents Peter and Lois; their children Meg, Chris, and Stewie; and their anthropomorphic pet dog Brian. 
                The show is set in the fictional city of Quahog, Rhode Island, and exhibits much of its humor in the form of cutaway gags that often lampoon American culture.
                </br>
                </br>
                The family was conceived by MacFarlane after developing two animated films, The Life of Larry and Larry & Steve. 
                MacFarlane redesigned the films' protagonist, Larry, and his dog, Steve, and renamed them Peter and Brian, respectively. 
                MacFarlane pitched a seven-minute pilot to Fox on May 15, 1998. 
                The show was given the green light and started production. 
                Shortly after the third season of Family Guy had aired in 2001, Fox cancelled the series, putting the series to a 2-year hiatus. However, favorable DVD sales and high ratings for syndicated reruns on Adult Swim convinced the network to renew the show in 2004 for a 4th season, which began airing on May 1, 2005.
                </br>
                </br>
                Family Guy has been nominated for 12 Primetime Emmy Awards and 11 Annie Awards, and has won three of each. 
                In 2009, it was nominated for an Emmy for Outstanding Comedy Series, the first time an animated series was nominated for the award since The Flintstones in 1961. 
                Family Guy has also received criticism, including unfavorable comparisons for its similarities to The Simpsons.
